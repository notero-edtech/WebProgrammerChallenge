- Write clean, well-structured code that is easy to read and maintain.
- Provide clear explanations and comments within the code to ensure understanding for others who may read or review the code.
- Test and run the program to ensure correctness and performance of the website.
- Once you have completed the testing, please submit the code and documentation to the Notero team through a Pull Request using the Forking Workflow.
