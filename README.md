# WebProgrammerChallenge
This is the website testing for a Web Developer position at Notero Team. The test duration is 5 days starting from the day you receive it. You will be using Visual Studio Code with Node.js and TypeScript for development.

Please read the following instructions carefully before you begin
- Create a new website using Node.js and TypeScript as the main languages for development.
- Design and build a main webpage (Homepage) that displays basic information such as the website name, subcontent, and accompanying images.
- Implement additional features to the website using Node.js and TypeScript. Examples include fetching and displaying data from external sources (APIs) or user data management.
- Include the website's installation and usage guide in the README.md file.
- Write clean, well-structured code that is easy to read and maintain.
- Provide clear explanations and comments within the code to ensure understanding for others who may read or review the code.
- Test and run the program to ensure the correctness and performance of the website.
- Once you have completed the testing, please submit the code and documentation to the Notero team through a Pull Request using the Forking Workflow.

Please do not hesitate to ask if you have any additional questions or require further assistance during the testing process. Good luck with your website testing!
